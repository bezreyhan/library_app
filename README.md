## Assumptions
An assumption I made was that when a consumer of the API requests a user's books, they want to know if those books have been read or not. For example, if you are building a UI that lists a user's books in a table, you may want to have a 'read' column so that the user can know if the book has been read or not. Therefor, when the API responds with a user's book, the response also contains a 'read' property.
